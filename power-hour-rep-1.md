# Power hour report 1
- Who was the speaker(s) and what company or companies were they from What was the topic of the talk?
  - Ted Spence
  - We talked alot about the gaming industry, but I think the main idea was giving us an idea of what will and won't help us get a job in the field/company we want.
- Share 1 or 2 ways the speakerâ€™s information will change your approach to your career transition.
  - I've been thinking alot about games lately because of some of the amazing new gaming technology coming out, but always assumed I would have to choose one field to stay in for the rest of my life. He made it clear that if I feel like changing fields into gaming later it would be perfectly possible so long as I can keep my passion and salary competitive.
  - I kept trying to find a company to intern for I had never thought about working on crowd sourced code to add to my portfolio. I'll almost definitely be doing that.
- Do you have any other key take-aways, or observations about this Partner Power Hour?
  - Passion in general is a major factor in the hiring process at any level of any company. Focusing on that could very well over shadow potentially negative history like gaps in work or a career change.
