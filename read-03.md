- ol - creates an ordered list. Unless otherwise stated the browser automatically adds decimal numbers in order from top to bottom at the beginning of each list item.
- ul - creates unordered list. Unless otherwise stated browser automatically adds bullet points or circles in order from top to bottom at the beginning of each list item.
- li - creates list item. It's parent element (ol/ul) determines what it will have in front of it unless otherwise stated in css. They appear in the order they are written into HTML.
- dl - creates definition list. Used to list a series of words (dt) and their definitions (dd).
- dt - creates a place for a term to be defined in a dl.
- dd - creates a place to define the word stated in the dt.
- creating a list branching from a list item can be done by putting a ul/ol inside a list item. This is known as a nested list.
- width and height can be assigned values of pixels taken up onscreen (px), percent of the parent element (%), or ems meaning the parent element changes based on the size of the text.
- min-width/min-height describes the minimum size the element can shrink to as the browser is compressed by the user.
- max-width/max-height describes the max size the window can be stretched to, to fit properly onscreen, as the user expands the browser.
- overflow tells the browser whether to hide the remaining text (hidden) or add a scroll bar (scroll) if the text is too large for its parent element.
- from inside out the box contains layers called padding, border and margin. background color only affect padding. color of border and (i'm assuming margin as well) have to be targeted specifically.
- margin, border and padding size can be targeted entirely with `margin:`, `border` or `padding:` or in specific directions with `margin-top:`, `margin-right:`, `margin-bottom:`, `margin-left:` and the same distinction for border and padding.
- ^that feature can be used to portray depth^
- the border can also be styled both as a whole and by top, right, bottom and left with values like solid, dotted, double, etc.
- if the whole border is to be the same all the way around you can also add several values to the property `border` ( `border: 1px solid black;`)
- display changes whether an element behaves like a block or an inline element. Maybe I can use inline to make the h1 tag on my site actually center with the images vertically??? nope...
- block makes an inline element behave like a block, inline block makes a block move to inline while retaining block characteristics.
- visibility doesn't remove the box of an element but does hide the content with the value set to hidden, while display with a vlue none hides the boc and its content allowing other elements to take it's place
- if/else statements - if `if` evaluates true it runs its block of code. I it evaluates false it moves on to `else if`. if `else if` evaluates false it moves on to `else`. else if and else are not mandatory to have an if statement and the number of else if is technically infinite.
- you can use several if statements to check to see how many statements are true. switch is a faster alternative to this option
- switch variable (the word in parenthesis) provides a variable defined outside the loop to be compared against all possible definitions (`case:`s) for the variable (whether the variable is assigned the value 'one', 'two ','three', etc.) whichever case is evaluated true will run its code block
- data types can be changed. the string `'1'` is converted to a number in: `('1' > 0)`
- js is said to use weak typing (values can change datatypes). this ability to change can cause problems later on so when checking a value it's best to use strict operators (`===` or `!==` instead of `==` or `!=`)
- arrays can contain differing value types, so can one of thoes values be an array? is so, can the nested array have a value equal to the parent array?
- to change a value in an array reference it as though it were a variable and set it equal to the new value (array[2] = newValue)
- can set variable equal to boolean by setting it equal to comparison equation
- falsy values include:
  - false
  - 0
  - empty string
  - unassigned value
  - empty value??? is technically assigned a value but the assigned value doesn't have any real meaning or use (10/'string')???
- truthy values include:
  - true
  - 1
  - full strings
  - num calculations
  - true as a tring
  - 0 as a string
  - false as a string
  - object/array
- if getelementbyid value is found it can return a truthy value (not equal to true just truthy) checks existence of elements on page || can be used
- undefined and null are relatively equal to eachother but not strictly and are not relatively or strictly equal to anything else
- you can use logical or when assigning value to a variable. with or the first truthy value will be assigned
- to minimize processing power usage:
  - place most likely to be true (for ||) first
  - place most likely to return false first for &&
  - place biggest values last when possible
- for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) var i = 0; initializes, i < 10 sets a condition and i++ updates the initializer for further review
- break forces the browser to exit the current loop and proceed to the next piece of code
- continue tells the loop to continue with that iteration and check the condition again immediately
- add something that assigns a falsy value to the condition if you get an infinite loop
- define as much as you resonably can outside loops so they're not recalc everytime it runs
