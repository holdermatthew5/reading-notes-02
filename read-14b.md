It seems alot like googles research indicates that it's a strong bond in the meeting room that matters and personalities and relationships outside of work don't matter. If this is true I guess the most important part of being in an effecient team is trust. Trust in your teammates not to criticise you too harshly and trust that your teammates will take your ideas seriously. In my experience in team work these 2 have always been a huge determining factor in my happiness in team settings as well as my ability to make a substantial contribution and motivation to keep trying. For that reason, this makes alot of sense. It also makes alot of sense of introductions to trainings. Every effective training session/class I've been in has started with some sort of ice breaker that often ends in everyone laughing together. Of course, some still became very dull and unproductive with people falling asleep left and right, but here it can be inferred that it was a result of the inability of the instructor to maintain that same energy from the beginning of class. This makes even more sense to me concidering my level of motivation through this course. Since 101 I've felt very welcome and involved and excited about learning and working, so it makes sense that I'm doing well in classwork (my punctuality could use some work, but I do well on assignments lol).
